# Xavier Framework - Colored Agent System

## Overview

Xavier Framework now features a colored agent visualization system that clearly shows which agent is working on each task, providing professional visual feedback throughout the development process.

## Features

### 🎨 Agent Color Coding

Each agent type has a unique color, emoji, and label for easy identification:

- **[PM]** 📊 ProjectManager - Magenta
- **[CTX]** 🔍 ContextManager - Blue
- **[PY]** 🐍 PythonEngineer - Green
- **[GO]** 🐹 GolangEngineer - Cyan
- **[FE]** 🎨 FrontendEngineer - Yellow
- **[RB]** 💎 RubyEngineer - Red
- **[JV]** ☕ JavaEngineer - Light Red
- **[OPS]** 🚀 DevOpsEngineer - Light Magenta
- **[DB]** 🗄️ DatabaseEngineer - Light Blue

### 📢 Visual Feedback

The system provides clear visual feedback for:

1. **Agent Takeover** - Shows when an agent starts working on a task with a colored box
2. **Status Updates** - Real-time status indicators (⚙️ Working, 🧪 Testing, ✅ Completed, etc.)
3. **Agent Handoffs** - Visual transitions when tasks move between agents
4. **Task Results** - Success/failure indicators with summaries

### 🔄 Agent Handoff Visualization

When a task moves from one agent to another, you'll see:
```
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
[PY] 🐍 PythonEngineer → [FE] 🎨 FrontendEngineer
Handoff: Backend API complete, frontend needed
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`xavier/src/utils/ansi_art.py`**
   - Added `AgentColors` class with color mappings
   - Created display functions for agent status, takeover, handoff, and results

2. **`xavier/src/agents/base_agent.py`**
   - Enhanced `BaseAgent` class with colored output methods
   - Added `start_task()`, `update_status()`, and `complete_task()` methods
   - Updated all agent `execute_task()` methods to use colored output

3. **`xavier/src/agents/orchestrator.py`**
   - Added agent handoff tracking
   - Enhanced `delegate_task()` with colored transitions
   - Updated sprint execution with visual progress indicators

## Usage

The colored agent system activates automatically when:

1. **Creating stories/tasks** - Project Manager estimates and assigns
2. **Starting sprints** - Agents take over tasks sequentially
3. **Executing features** - Shows TDD process with test-first approach
4. **Completing tasks** - Visual success/failure indicators

## Testing

Run the test script to see the colored agents in action:

```bash
python3 test_colored_agents.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Individual agent displays
- Task delegation with colors
- Agent handoffs between different specialists
- Sprint execution with visual feedback

## Benefits

1. **Clear Visibility** - Always know which agent is working
2. **Better Debugging** - Track task flow through agents
3. **Professional CLI** - Polished, modern terminal experience
4. **Task Transparency** - See TDD and Clean Code enforcement

## Technical Implementation

| Feature | Xavier Implementation |
|---------|----------------------|
| Agent Colors | Custom ANSI colors with emojis |
| Agent Names | Displayed in CLI with labels |
| Task Handoffs | Visual transitions between agents |
| Status Updates | Real-time feedback with icons |
| Architecture | Python-based display system |

## Future Enhancements

1. **Claude Code Integration** - Create actual `.claude/agents/` definitions
2. **Dynamic Colors** - User-configurable color schemes
3. **Progress Bars** - Visual progress for long-running tasks
4. **Agent Metrics** - Track agent performance and task completion rates
5. **Interactive Mode** - Allow manual agent selection for tasks

## Conclusion

Xavier's colored agent system provides exceptional visual clarity, making it easy to see which specialized agent is handling each part of your development workflow. The system maintains Xavier's strict boundaries while adding professional visual feedback throughout the development process.
