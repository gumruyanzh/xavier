# Xavier Self-Hosting Architecture Plan
## Using Xavier Framework to Develop Xavier Framework

### Executive Summary
Enable Xavier Framework to use its own SCRUM management, agent orchestration, and development workflow features for its own development. This creates a self-improving system where Xavier's capabilities are used to enhance Xavier itself.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Dogfooding**: Use Xavier to develop Xavier, ensuring we experience what users experience
2. **Self-Improvement**: Leverage Xavier's features to improve Xavier's development efficiency
3. **Quality Assurance**: Apply Xavier's strict standards to Xavier's own codebase
4. **Meta-Development**: Create a recursive development environment

```python
# xavier_self_init.py
def initialize_xavier_for_self():
    """Initialize Xavier to manage its own development"""

    # Create Xavier project
    xavier_commands.create_project({

## 📝 Notes

- Avoid infinite recursion in self-referential features
- Maintain clear boundaries between Xavier-the-framework and Xavier-the-project
- Ensure bootstrap capability (Xavier can rebuild itself from scratch)
- Document all meta-features thoroughly
- Test edge cases in recursive scenarios

---

## 🤝 Getting Started

To begin using Xavier for Xavier development:

```bash
# Initialize Xavier for self-development
cd /path/to/xavier
python xavier/xavier_self_init.py

# Create first Xavier development story
/xavier-story "Implement self-hosting capabilities"

# Start Xavier development sprint
/xavier-sprint "Self-Hosting Sprint 1"

# Begin development with Xavier agents
/start-sprint
```
