# Git Worktree Status Report

## Customer Feedback Response

**Original Feedback:**
1. ✅ Sub agent system seems working
2. ❌ Git worktrees is not working

## Investigation Results

### Git Worktrees ARE Working ✅

After thorough investigation and testing, I can confirm that **git worktrees are fully functional**:

#### Test Results
- ✅ All 17/17 worktree tests passing
- ✅ Fixed failing test (`test_agent_worktree_creation`)
- ✅ Manual testing confirms worktree creation works
- ✅ Currently 21 active worktrees exist in the system

#### Evidence
```bash
# Run verification
python3 verify_worktree.py

# Output shows:
✓ Worktree directory: /Users/Toto/Projects/xavier/trees
✓ Found 21 active worktree(s)
✓ Git worktree functionality is working correctly!
```

### How Worktrees Work

1. **Automatic Creation**: Worktrees are created automatically when agents start tasks
2. **Location**: All worktrees are in the `trees/` directory
3. **Branch Naming**: Each worktree has its own branch: `<agent-name>/<task-id>`
4. **Isolation**: Each agent works in isolation to avoid conflicts

### Verification Steps

To verify worktrees are working on your system:

```bash
# 1. Run the verification script
python3 verify_worktree.py

# 2. Check the trees directory
ls -la trees/

# 3. List git worktrees
git worktree list

# 4. Check branches
git branch --all | grep "python-engineer\|frontend-engineer"
```

### What Was Fixed

1. **Test Fix**: Corrected the mock patch path in `test_agent_worktree_creation`
   - Changed from: `@patch('xavier.src.git_worktree.GitWorktreeManager')`
   - Changed to: `@patch('xavier.src.agents.base_agent.GitWorktreeManager')`
   - Reason: BaseAgent uses a relative import, so patch must target where it's used

2. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive troubleshooting section to `docs/GIT_WORKTREE_WORKFLOW.md`
   - Verification steps
   - Common issues and solutions
   - How to check if worktrees are working

3. **Verification Script**: Created `verify_worktree.py` for easy status checking

### Why It Might Seem "Not Working"

Possible reasons for confusion:

1. **Visibility**: Worktrees work silently in the background
   - No obvious UI feedback
   - Need to check `trees/` directory or run verification script

2. **Automatic Cleanup**: Some worktrees may be cleaned up after task completion

3. **Location**: Worktrees are in `trees/` directory, not in the main workspace

### Next Steps

To use git worktrees effectively:

1. **Start a sprint**: Worktrees are created for all tasks
2. **Start a task**: Agent automatically creates a worktree
3. **Verify**: Run `python3 verify_worktree.py` to see active worktrees
4. **Monitor**: Check `trees/` directory to see worktree directories
5. **Clean up**: Use `GitWorktreeManager.cleanup_worktrees()` to remove old ones

## Summary

✅ **Git worktrees are fully functional**
✅ **All tests passing (17/17)**
✅ **21 active worktrees currently exist**
✅ **Verification tools provided**
✅ **Documentation updated with troubleshooting**

The feature is working as designed. The perceived issue was likely due to lack of
visibility into the worktree status. Use `verify_worktree.py` to check status anytime.

## Files Changed

1. `xavier/tests/test_git_worktree.py` - Fixed test patch path
2. `verify_worktree.py` - New verification script
3. `docs/GIT_WORKTREE_WORKFLOW.md` - Added troubleshooting section
4. `WORKTREE_STATUS.md` - This status report

## Commands

```bash
# Verify worktrees are working
python3 verify_worktree.py

# Run all worktree tests
python3 -m pytest xavier/tests/test_git_worktree.py -v

# Check active worktrees
git worktree list

# Clean up old worktrees
python3 -c "from xavier.src.git_worktree import GitWorktreeManager; GitWorktreeManager().cleanup_worktrees()"
```
